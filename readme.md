## üí° Key Recommendations

| Area                  | Recommendation                                                             | Expected Impact          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Sales**             | Strengthen off-season campaigns (Q1‚ÄìQ2) to reduce sales gaps.              | Increase annual revenue  |
| **Product**           | Focus inventory on **Fashion Accessories** & **Home & Lifestyle**.         | Reduce stockouts         |
| **Profitability**     | Review supplier terms in high-volume categories to lift margins.           | Improve NPM by +2‚Äì3%     |
| **Customer Behavior** | Incentivize repeat purchases in **Sports & Travel** & **Health & Beauty**. | Boost AOV                |
| **Seasonal Strategy** | Leverage Q4 trends with early marketing rollouts.                          | Sustain peak performance |

## üìà Business Recomendation :

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Focus marketing and cross-selling efforts on Sports & Travel, Health & Beauty, and Food & Beverages, which show the highest AOV. These categories attract high-spending customers, so personalized promotions or bundle discounts could increase order frequency without lowering ticket size. For lower AOV categories, review pricing strategy or product bundling to lift average spend per transaction.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Maintain strong momentum in Fashion Accessories and Home & Lifestyle, which are the top revenue drivers. However, to sustain long-term growth, consider developing targeted campaigns to boost underperforming categories like Electronics and Food & Beverages. This diversification reduces revenue dependency on a few product lines and supports balanced portfolio growth.
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ While overall margins are stable across categories (~39‚Äì40%), focus on optimizing cost efficiency within Fashion Accessories and Home & Lifestyle, which, despite high sales, operate on thinner margins. A cost review or supplier negotiation in these categories could increase profitability. Additionally, replicate successful pricing or sourcing strategies from Food & Beverages, which demonstrates better margin efficiency.
- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure sufficient stock levels for Home & Lifestyle and Fashion Accessories, where rapid turnover reflects high demand. At the same time, evaluate inventory management for Health & Beauty and Sports & Travel, which show slower rotation ‚Äî consider reducing order volume, running promotions, or optimizing SKU assortment to avoid capital lock-up in low-movement inventory.
- 5Ô∏è‚É£ Leverage Q4‚Äôs strong seasonal momentum by planning early campaigns and inventory ramp-ups before peak season. To stabilize revenue across the year, explore strategies that drive engagement during off-peak quarters (Q2‚ÄìQ3), such as mid-year promotions, loyalty programs, or special product launches. This helps smooth out sales volatility and maintain consistent cash flow.
